    <p><b>Don't forget to say hi to Jollibee and the crew!</b></p>
    <p>They were inspired by a concept referred to by creators and scholars as "Filipino Optimism." This embodies a set of fundamental values often linked with Filipinos, including being centered on family, politeness, hospitality, gratitude, a sense of shame, adaptability, loyalty, hard work, and a resignation often expressed as the "Bahala na" attitude.</p>

        <li>In 1980, <b>Jollibee</b>, the iconic mascot, was launched as the original face of the food chain. Sporting a red suit and chef’s hat, this beloved anthropomorphic bee quickly became the symbol of joy and happiness for customers.</li><br>
        <li><b>Popo</b> first appeared in 1980 to promote French Fries. Initially depicted as a boy in a red shirt and blue overalls with hair resembling thick fries and a hat shaped like a fries carton, his look was later updated to a sleeker blue tracksuit and a sideways, upside-down running visor in place of his hat. Popo remains an active member of the Jollibee crew.</li><br>
        <li>Originally introduced between 1980 and 1983 as “Mr. Yum” to promote the “yum” hamburger line, this mascot was depicted as a dark-suited man with a bowler hat shaped like a “yum burger.” In 2009, he underwent a makeover and was renamed <b>Yum,</b> now sporting a youthful look with yellow visor shades but retaining his burger-shaped hat.</li><br>
        <li><b>Twirlie</b> was introduced in 1988 to promote the “Twirly” Sundaes. This vibrant female mascot wears purple and pink, with a hairstyle that mirrors a sundae. She is actively involved and frequently appears in promotional materials and events.</li><br>
        <li>Last but definetly not the least, <b>Hetty</b>, the last addition to the Jollibee crew, was introduced in 1984 to endorse the “jolly spaghetti” product line. Designed as a young girl with blond hair resembling spaghetti strands, she has become a fan favorite after Jollibee and continues to be a prominent figure in the jolly crew.</li><br>
